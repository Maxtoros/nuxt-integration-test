# Frontend test for Jus Mundi

This exercice aims to integrate a simple page containing animations using only CSS ( no CSS libs, SASS or LESS are ok ).

# Instructions

Create **only following sections** although the Figma shows entire page.

1. Header block with animation
2. Quotes block
3. Why partnership block

Instructions talk about adaptive design : "The web page should be adaptative. (not mobile first)" which seems to be an error since we have only one screen on the figma.
We assume that it's a responsive design that was asked or we can choose how to adapt other breakpoints to our liking.We'll see later how we're going to handle that part but if we can get a clear answer on monday about it, it would be good.

### Test checklist

- [ ] integrate a basic boilerplate with my usual tools for controls, semVer etc ...
- [ ] create the basic layout and shell components for our conception
- [ ] Add static assets and content.
- [ ] Style the whole page and components without animations
- [ ] Add animations
- [ ] Check and review visually the result
- [ ] Check and review the code, git history for any missed fixups or any other anomalies
- [ ] To be continued ...
